Problem we are solving: creating a Bingo game



Use the main method as the client program.
Call all methods in the main method.
Create an ArrayList for storing the random numbers and an Array that has dimension of 5 by 5 for the bingo card.
The main method will call the print out method, print out card, and play game methods.


Create five methods:

1. I will create a method to fill up the bingo card using the input file "bingo.in"
2. I will create a method that will print out the card where all the things in the board will line up.
3. I will create a method to generate a random number that does not repeat itself.
4. I will create a method that will contain the main actions of the game (other methods will be called).
5. I will create a method to check to see if there is a win and how the player won the game.






In the fillCard method, I will use a Scanner object to import the file into the bingo card. The Scanner will receive input by using 
nextInt().The bingoCard array will be passed as a parameter.


In the printCard method, I will use a print statement to print out "YOUR BINGO CARD:" , the word BINGO, and the dashed line underneath. 
Then, I will create a for loop that will allow me to iterate through the bingo card array. I will start printing out the "|" and then use an if/else statement to determine if to print the numbers or an X. The if statement will be if the bingocard's currrent position equals zero,
print an "X". The else statement will just print the card normally with the numbers. After every row is printed, it will create the dashed
line underneath. This process will continue till it iterates through the whole for loop. The bingoCard array will be passed as a parameter.

In the randomnumber method,the bingoCard array and the ArrayList that stores random numbers will be passed. I will create an integer 
that stores a random number. It will go through the ArrayList and see if that random number is already in the ArrayList using a while loop.
Once, a random number is created it will be added to the ArrayList. It will go through the bingoCard using a for loop and see if that number is on the card. If the number is on the card, the value will be changed to zero.


In the playGame method, the ArrayList of random numbers and the array BingoCard will be passed. Using a while loop, I will check to see if 
there is a win. The while loop will keep generating random numbers till a win is found. The while loop will call the checkForWin method. 
Then, I will put an if statement just to make sure that checkForWin actually is a win. Then, it will start printing out the random numbers 
from the bin, what type of win, and the number of picks. I will use a switch statement to determine what to print depending on what the win
equals to.


In the checkForWin method, I will create constants using integers to determine what tyoe of win it is and create a sum variable. I will
have four different sets of four loop for each type of win. For the horizontal check, I will nest the if the sum is zero condition after eachinner loop is processed. I will do something similar for the vertical check. For the diagonal checks, I will create a variable to ensure
that the for loop for the diagonals actually iterates through the whole diagonal. There will be return statements within each for loop 
corresponding to the appropriate type of win. If no win is found, then it will return NOWIN where the value is zero. The bingoCard will
be passed as a parameter.
